# Local Deployment

Docker deployment is currently the easiest way to deploy Blockscout locally. See the [Docker-compose Deployment](../setup-and-run-blockscout/deployment/docker-compose-deployment.md) section for instructions.

If you prefer to deploy manually, [follow these instructions](../setup-and-run-blockscout/deployment/manual-deployment-guide/).
