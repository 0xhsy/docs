# What are the different transaction types?

**There are 3 transaction types which can be accessed from the tabs menu for an EOA (Externally Owned Address) or Smart Contract.**

**Transactions:**\
An EOA, commonly known as a wallet address, initiates a transaction. Both incoming and outgoing transactions are recorded here, and includes includes any transaction that requires a gas fee (in the native token ETH, xDai etc) for execution.

**Token Transfers:**\
Transactions of ERC-20 or ERC-721 tokens. **** This can include DeFi transactions (like adding or removing liquidity), EOA transfers, airdrops or other transactions where non-native tokens are sent and received.

**Internal Transactions:**\
Transactions initiated and executed between smart contracts. Internal transactions are the result of an external transaction (EOA to contract). This initial transaction can then trigger many internal transactions between contracts as functions are called.
