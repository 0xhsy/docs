# What are the different transaction types?

**There are 3 transaction types which can be accessed from the tabs menu for an EOA (Externally Owned Address) or Smart Contract.**

**Transactions:**\
An EOA, commonly known as a wallet address, sends the native token (ETH, xDAI, etc) to another EOA or smart contract. This includes any transaction that requires gas for execution.

**Token Transfers:**\
Transactions of ERC-20 or ERC-721 tokens. **** This can include DeFi transactions (like adding or removing liquidity), EOA transfers or other transactions where non-native tokens are exchanged.

**Internal Transactions:**\
Transactions executed between smart contracts. A single transaction (EOA to contract) can result in many internal transactions.
