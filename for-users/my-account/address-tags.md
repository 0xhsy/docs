# Address Tags

Address tags are useful for tracking specific addresses, either EOAs (Externally Owned Addresses) or smart contracts. When logged in, a small grey tag is added with the selected name to any specified addresses.

Use cases might include tags for specific wallet accounts (EOAs) of interest, Gnosis safe multisig wallets to highlight, or tags for specific applications, tokens, NFTs etc.

**1)  Login to My Account in Blockscout** <[_login instructions_](./)> to create a tag.

1. Go to Address Tags in the user menu.

1. Address. Double check you are entering the correct address for the chain. Search the address in Blockscout to confirm.
2. Name. Create a name for the tag (35 characters or less). Emojis are a nice way to differentiate and add style and color to tags.
3. Press Save.
