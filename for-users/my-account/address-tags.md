# Address Tags

Address tags are useful for tracking specific addresses, either EOAs (Externally Owned Addresses) or smart contracts. When you are logged in, a small grey tag will be added with the name you select to any specified addresses.

Use cases might include tags for specific wallet accounts (EOAs) you are interested in, Gnosis safe multisig wallets you want highlighted, or tags for specific applications, tokens, NFTs etc.

**1) Login to Blockscout** to create a tag.

1. Go to Address Tags in the user menu.
2. Press Add address tag.

1. Address. Double check you are entering the correct address for the chain. Search the address in Blockscout to confirm.
2. Name. Create a name for the tag (35 characters or less). Emojis are a nice way to differentiate and add style and color to tags.
3. Press Save.
