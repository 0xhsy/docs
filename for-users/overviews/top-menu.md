# Top Menu

The top menu contains navigational items for organizing your exploration. Different instances can have different menus depending on the needs of the chain.&#x20;

## Blocks

* **Blocks:** Access high-level data for blocks, beginning with the most recent.\
  <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/blocks-1.png" alt="" data-size="original">
* **Uncles:** Not valid for PoS consensus (but available for PoW consensus chains such as Ethereum Classic), uncles are created when 2 blocks are mined at the same time. Only 1 block can be added to the chain, and Uncles are the blocks that are not added, but miners still receive rewards for these blocks.
* **Forked Blocks (Reorgs):** Blocks which are not included in the primary chain due to chain reorganizations.

### Transactions

* **Mined**: Transactions which have been added to the chain, either by validators or miners depending on the chain type.
* **Pending**: Transactions still in the mempool which are waiting to be mined. These transactions may be mined or excluded depending on gas fees or network congestion.
