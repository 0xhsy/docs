🚄 [**Hosting on blockscout.com**](your-chain-on-blockscout.com.md): Self-hosting can be difficult, often requiring a dev-ops team to make critical in-house updates and/or customizations. A BlockScout-hosted chain not only gives projects access to expert, dedicated technical support, it also greatly increases project visibility.

🦎 [**Custom Themes:**](custom-branded-themes.md) Custom themes help create a seamless blockchain experience for users.  A consistent look and feel helps orient the user, and custom elements like links to various related elements \(NFTs, website links etc\) can increase engagement and trust with your application across platforms.

👩💻 **Priority Updates:** The xDai BlockScout instance is updated regularly with the latest functionality. Premium hosted versions of BlockScout receive these same updates and patches simultaneously with any updates pushed to the xDai chain. This includes community requested features, UI enhancements, protocol updates, fixes, and any other additions.

\*\*\*\*👨💻 **Priority Support:** Premium customers receive personalized, priority assistance from the BlockScout support team. The BlockScout team responds to issues, requests, and bug reports from premium customers first and responds to your team's requests through a dedicated support channel.

\*\*\*\*🐍 **Vyper Smart Contracts Support:** [Vyper](https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is gaining more popularity as devs with Python experience move into the blockchain space. The Vyper Smart Contracts Verification module can be added and customized to your blockscout instance to allow for easy on-chain vyper contract interaction and verification.

\*\*\*\*👨🔬 **Premium Transaction Pages:**  Enhancements to the transaction pages layout gives users additional transaction data fields displayed and organized in a user-friendly, easy-to-read format. 

🤹 **ERC-1155 Support:**  [ERC-1155s](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) are increasingly popular for batching and flexible multi-token interactions. ERC-1155 support includes instance recognition, single and batched transfer parsing and indexing for both fungible and non-fungible tokens.

🌜 [**Moonbeam Support**](moonbeam-support.md)**:** We offer support and customizations specific to MoonBeam parachain contracts.

✍ [**Advanced CSV Exports**](export-to-csv.md)**:** Additional functionality is added to the basic CSV support. Users can define a time period and download chain data to csv including transactions, internal transactions, tokens and logs for any address.
