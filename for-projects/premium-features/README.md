# Premium features

Custom integrations and premium functionality are available for projects looking to extend their BlockScout instances. Examples include [Sourcify contract verification](contracts-verification-via-sourcify.md), custom project skins, and [MoonBeam support](moonbeam-support.md). 

We are compiling a list of available premium features. If your project has an item they would like added to BlockScout, [contact our team](https://forum.poa.network/c/blockscout/28) to discuss the details.
