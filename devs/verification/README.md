# Smart Contract Verification

Once verified, a smart contract or token contract's source code becomes publicly available and verifiable, creating transparency and trust. It also allows for interactivity with methods directly through the Read and Write buttons.

There are many different ways to verify your contracts with Blockscout.

* [Blockscout UI](blockscout-ui.md)
* [Verification API](blockscout-smart-contract-verification-api.md)
* [Hardhat Plugin](hardhat-verification-plugin/)
* [Foundry Verification](foundry-verification.md)
* [Sourcify Verification](contracts-verification-via-sourcify.md)
* [OpenZeppelin Contract Verification](openzeppelin-contract-verification.md)
* [Automate verification with Catapulta](automate-verifications-catapulta.md)
* [Thirdweb verification](verification-via-thirdweb.md)
