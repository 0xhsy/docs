### Get Started with Autoscout

1. **Create an account:** To get started, go to [https://deploy.blockscout.com/](https://deploy.blockscout.com/), create an account, and login with the login button.&#x20;
2. **Request credits:** You will need credits to launch your explorer. Please let us know that you have created an instance in the [Blockscout Discord](https://discord.gg/blockscout) `#autoscout` channel and we will top off your account for testing.&#x20;
3. **Add a new instance:** You can start adding an instance before credits are added to your account. Click the Add instance button to get started.
4. **Add your network info**:  See below for info on configuration and parameters.
5. **Deploy your explorer:** Click save and deploy to start the deployment process. In 5-10 minutes your explorer will be live and indexing your chain. Once deployed you can access your explorer link.
