# Bug Bounty Program

Welcome to the Bug Bounty Program at Blockscout! Ensuring the safety of our platform is a top priority, and we greatly appreciate the **crucial role security researchers play in contributing to open source**. Should you identify a possible security vulnerability within our platform, we invite you to join our bug bounty program and share your findings.

### How to report a security vulnerability

Send us an email with the information below. We ask that you lease keep your findings confidential during the reporting process.  We will get back to you with our findings or additional questions within 1 week.

1.  **Description of the bug/vulnerability**

    Clearly describe the vulnerability you've discovered.
2. **Steps to reproduce**\
   Outline the steps needed to replicate the vulnerability.
3.  **Impact analysis**

    Assess the potential impact of the vulnerability on users, developers, and the organization.
4. **Code fix (optional)**\
   If possible and appropriate, you may include a suggested code fix for the vulnerability.
