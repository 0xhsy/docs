# Bug Bounty Program

Welcome to the Bug Bounty Program at Blockscout! Ensuring the safety of our platform is a top priority, and we greatly appreciate the crucial role that security researchers play in contributing to open source. Should you identify a possible security vulnerability within our platform, we invite you to join our bug bounty program and share your findings.

### How to report a security vulnerability

1.  **Description of the bug/vulnerability**

    Clearly describe the vulnerability you've discovered
2. **Steps to reproduce**\
   Outline the steps needed to replicate the vulnerability
3.  **Impact analysis**

    Assess the potential impact of the vulnerability on users, developers, and the organization
4. **Code fix (optional)**\
   If possible and appropriate, you may include a suggested code fix for the vulnerability
5.  **Type of vulnerability**

    Choose a label that best fits the category of the bug for classification purposes. This aids in rewards distribution and participation. The categories include:

We are looking for vulnerabilities in the following areas:

* Business logic issues
* Remote code execution (RCE)
* Database vulnerability, SQLi
* File inclusions (Local & Remote)
* Access Control Issues (IDOR, Privilege Escalation, etc)
* Leakage of sensitive information
* Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
* Other vulnerability with a clear potential loss

**Out of Scope**

Unless presenting a serious business risk (at our discretion), the following are typically not eligible for rewards:

* Minor visual bugs, spelling errors, etc.
* Social engineering tactics (e.g., phishing)
* Issues in applications or systems not listed in the scope

* Security flaws in third-party apps or services
* Non-impactful XSS exploits
* CSRF-XSS issues related to login/logout
* Issues related to https/ssl or server-info disclosure
* Mixed Content Scripts
* Brute Force attacks
* General best practices concerns
* Recently disclosed 0day vulnerabilities
* Username/email enumeration via error messages
* Missing HTTP security headers
* Weak password policies
* HTML injection

7. **Additional Context**
