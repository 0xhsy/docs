# Projects Using Blockscout

Blockscout serves a wide range of execution-layer chains within the Ethereum ecosystem. Projects can deploy themselves to support their chains, or use Blockscout customization and/or hosting services to augment their instances.

See the [complete projects list](supported-projects.md), and explore more details in the [hosted](hosted-blockscout.md) and [self-hosted](self-hosted-blockscout-on-byo-servers.md) areas. &#x20;
