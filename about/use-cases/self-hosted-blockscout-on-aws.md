# Self-hosted BlockScout on AWS

BlockScout [Ansible Playbooks ](../../for-developers/ansible-deployment/)and the upcoming [AWS Marketplace ](../../for-developers/aws-marketplace/)integration provide several step-by-step options for deploying to AWS. This is the easiest way quickly connect BlockScout to your chain instance and get up and running quickly.

Projects may also decide to self-host on AWS and use a proxy server for additional load balancing, data caching or security.

Sites can be configured to reflect a chain's unique branding, color scheme, logos and more. See the examples below.
