# Self-hosted BlockScout on BYO Servers

BlockScout can be [manually deployed](../../for-developers/manual-deployment/) to a selected server environment. This provides control over costs, server location, decentralization and other factors that may influence hosting decisions.

Projects may also self-host and use a proxy server for additional load balancing, data caching or security.

Sites can be configured to reflect a chain's unique branding, color scheme, logos and more. See the examples below.
