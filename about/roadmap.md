# RoadMap

## ERC721 Metadata

**Target Date:** Q4 2019

[ERC-721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md) non-fungible tokens represent ownership of digital or physical assets. Each token is unique, and may include images and other data which identifies the asset and provides additional information. This might include registration information \(for example land, property or art registration\), identifying numbers or other data unique to that token. As ERC-721 tokens continue to proliferate, it is important to display the relevant information related to each owned token. 

## Staking DApp Integration

**Target Date:** Q1 2020

BlockScout will support the new POSDAO staking consensus mechanism through an on-board UI. The initial implementation will support the [xDai Stable Chain](https://xdaichain.com). This will allow users to place stake directly from the interface, monitor validator activity, and participate in consensus on the xDai Chain.

## Smart Contract Write Functionality

**Target Date:** Q1 2020

Users can currently verify and read contracts on BlockScout. The next smart contract development phase will allow users to interact with contracts directly through the interface.  Verified contract methods will be accessible and users can connect through a web3 wallet \(such as MetaMask\) to access and execute contract functions.

## Performance Optimizations

**Target Date:** Ongoing

As chain data grows exponentially, load speed, database optimization & caching, data parsing and front-end improvements are all required to maintain optimal performance. These efforts will continue as additional features are added to BlockScout.
