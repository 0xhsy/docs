Blockscout, the leading open-source blockchain explorer for EVM compatible chains, has announced the launch of Blockscout 2.0 on [Base](https://base.org/), a new L2 chain incubated by the [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) team to offer a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly way to build dapps onchain. This redesigned version of Blockscout brings dynamic, customizable, and open-source chain exploration to the Base ecosystem.

Base leverages the open-source OP Stack while relying on Ethereum for L1 security, and Blockscout provides a reliable open-source explorer for viewing transactions, batches, accounts, tokens, validation, and L1<-> L2 activity. Blockscout 2.0 features a redesigned interface, optimized API performance, and interactive features like a dApp marketplace, MyAccount functionality, and advanced smart contract verification for Base developers and users.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been building Blockscout for nearly 5 years with a goal to provide a reliable, transparent, and decentralized explorer to networks throughout the ecosystem,‚Äù said Blockscout founder Igor Barinov. ‚ÄúWith 2.0, we‚Äôve upgraded Blockscout to be faster, more customizable, and extremely developer-friendly. The Optimism team was instrumental in helping with this collaboration and we‚Äôre excited to work with Base and other teams within the Base ecosystem to premier our new explorer at launch. Blockscout 2.0 empowers Base users and other L2 users to explore all of their on-chain activity and interact with the chain itself using an open-source solution."

Blockscout 2.0 is designed to benefit users, developers and projects, providing a complementary alternative to centralized, proprietary explorers in the space. Newly configured and optimized APIs, a dedicated smart contract verification microservice, and extensive analytics tools help support projects as they deploy and grow within the Base ecosystem.

‚ÄúAccess to reliable, transparent onchain data is critical for web3 developers and users alike. We are excited to work with onchain explorers such as Blockscout to provide Base developers with solutions that make it even easier to build their dapps, and for users to easily understand their onchain activity" said Base lead Jesse Pollak.
