<summary>How do I receive referral rewards?</summary>

You do not receive referral rewards when someone first signs up using your referral code or claims their daily bonus.&#x20;

However, you will receive rewards (10% of the Merits they earn) for block explorer usage or activities/campaigns they complete. These rewards will accumulate to your account, and you can claim to your account with the claim button in the dashboard. &#x20;

Activities which earn referral rewards are still in development, and will be listed once they become available.&#x20;
